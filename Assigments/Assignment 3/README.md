# Assignment 3 - Linear Regression

|Dataset|Requirements|
|:-|:-|
|fish.csv|Using ‘Length1’, ‘Length2’, ‘Length3’, ‘Height’, ‘Width’ attributes to predict the fish weight (‘Weight’)|
|insurance.csv|Using all attributes (except ‘charges’) to predict the medical insurance cost (‘charges’)|
|wine.csv|Using all attributes (except ‘quaility’) to predict the quality of wine (‘quality’)|
|weather.csv|Using all attributes (except ‘Temperature_c’) to predict the outside’s temperature (‘Temperature_c’)|

## Requirements

### Normal Equation

- Standardazing data
- Splitting data into the training and testing set with ratio 7:3 (70% training, 30% testing)
- Using MSE and R2 score to evaluate the performance (using sklearn.metrics)

### Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent

- Standardazing data
- Splitting data into the training and testing set with ratio 7:3 (70% training, 30% testing)
- Coding from scratch for Gradient Descent.
- Using library for Stochastic Gradient Descent.
- Visualizing the cost (only for Gradient Descent)
- Using MSE and R2 score to evaluate the performance (using sklearn.metrics)
